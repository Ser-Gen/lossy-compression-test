This file describes the various metrics which the test suite implements.

Metric 1
================================

Convert an image to JPEG qualities 50-96, resulting in 46 images.

Convert the same image to target format 46 times, where metric (e.g. SSIM) matches with each of the 46 JPEGs.

Metric 1: Add up total size of all JPEG images, add up total size of all target format images, and give a percentage improvement.

Metric 2
=================================

Convert an image to JPEG qualities 50-96, resulting in 46 images.

Convert the same image to target format 46 times, where metric (e.g. SSIM) matches with each of the 46 JPEGs.

Metric 2: For each image pair, calculate the percentage improvement and then calculate the arithmetic mean of all percentages.
